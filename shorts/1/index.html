    <h1>Unbricking a BIOS-bricked motherboard</h1>

    Have you ever been in a situation when flashing a new BIOS goes wrong and your motherboard become a doorstop? We've all been there, so keep on reading.
    
    <h2>How to flash a new BIOS without the motherboard even POSTing</h2>
    <i>Note:</i> This tutorial is meant for AMI BIOSes. Said that, you can google the procedure for your particular BIOS.

    <ol>
        <li>Download a working BIOS for your motherboard from a trusted website</li>
        <li>
            If it's an EXE or ZIP try to extract the files within with something like 7-Zip. The BIOS file should be:
            <ul>
                <li>Usually ending with .ROM</li>
                <li>Being of a power of 2 in size (like 1MB, 2MB, 4MB, ...)</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li>If your motherboard is old enough to have a floppy connector go head and plug it in</li>
        <li>If (lucky you) your motherboard doesn't have any floppy connector it means that you can just use a normal USB key</li>
        <li>Find a floppy (or a USB key) and format it using FAT</li>
        <li>
            Take the BIOS file, rename it to <code>AMIBOOT.ROM</code> and copy it to the floppy/USB key
            <ul>
                <li>If your motherboard is an HP one, use <code>HPBIOS.ROM</code> instead</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li>Insert the floppy/USB key in the right place</li>
        <li>If your motherboard has a PS/2 keyboard connector please use one, otherwise just use your normal USB keyboard</li>
        <li>While powering on your PC hold <code>CTRL+HOME</code> until you see the floppy drive/USB key LED blinking</li>
        <li>Wait until you hear 5 beeps</li>
        <li>Reboot</li>
    </ol>
